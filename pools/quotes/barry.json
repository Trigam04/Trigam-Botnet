    "Yeah, let's shake it up a little.",

    "Oh, hang on a second.",
    "Hello?",
    "Adam?",
    "I can't believe it. I'll pick you up.",
    "Lookin' sharp.",
    "Sorry. I'm excited.",
    "Ma! I got a thing going here.",
    "Ow! That's me!",
    "Bye!",
    "Hey, Adam.",
    "A little. It's a special day, finally graduating.",
    "Yeah, three days grade school, three days high school.",
    "Three days college.",
    "I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive.",
    "Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.",
    "Yeah.",
    "No, I'm not goin' to his funeral.",
    "Everybody knows you sting someone, you die.",
    "You don't waste it on a squirrel.",
    "He was such a hothead.",
    "I guess that's why they say we don't need a vacation.",
    "Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.",
    "Well, Adam, today we are men.",
    "Bee-men.",
    "Are we gonna pick our jobs today?",
    "Huh. Woah. Heads up! Here we go.",
    "Wonder what it's going to be like?",
    "This is it!",
    "Wow.",
    "She's my cousin!",
    "Yes, we're all cousins.",
    "Not enough.",
    "Wow, what does that do?",
    "The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.",
    "Huh?",
    "So you'll just work us to death?",
    "\"What's the difference?\"",
    "Adam, how could you say that?",
    "One job forever?",
    "That's an insane choice to have to make.",
    "But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?",
    "Yeah, but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here?",
    "I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.",
    "Wait a second. Check it out.",
    "Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!",
    "They know what it's like to go outside the hive.",
    "I wonder where those guys have just been.",
    "Their day's not planned.",
    "Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.",
    "Right.",
    "Look at that.",
    "That's more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime.",
    "Perhaps.",

    "One time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom!",

    "Six miles, huh?",
    "Maybe I am.",
    "I might be.",
    "It all depends on what 0900 means.",
    "Oh! Dad, you surprised me.",
    "Well, there's a lot of choices.",
    "Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?",
    "You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.",
    "Well, no...",
    "I'm not trying to be funny.",
    "No one's listening to me!",

    "Oof! Ow! What was that?",
    "Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This, this, this, this-",
    "Ah! Drapes!",
    "That is diabolical.",
    "No wonder we’re not supposed to talk to them.",
    "They're out of their minds.",

    "She saved my life.",
    "I've got to say something.",

    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah, I am a bee.",
    "And, uh, you know I'm not supposed to be doing this, but...",
    "...they were all trying to kill me.",
    "And if it wasn't for you... I mean, I had to thank you.",
    "It's, it's just the way I was raised.",
    "Oh! That was a little weird.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Anyway...",
    "Um, I just want to say I'm grateful, and I'm going to leave now.",
    "What?",
    "Oh, same way you did, I guess.",
    "\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Bees are funny.",
    "If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.",
    "Anyway...",
    "Like what?",
    "Well, uh, I don't want to put you out, unless you're making it anyway.",
    "Really?",
    "I hate to impose.",
    "Actually, I would love a cup.",

    "No, no, no, I can't.",

    "He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.",
    "So he finally gets there.",
    "He runs up the steps into the church.",
    "The wedding is on...",
    "...and he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.\"",
    "Why would I marry a watermelon?",
    "Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that we do.",
    "About work?",
    "I don't know.",
    "I want to do my part for the hive, but I, I can't do it the way they want.",
    "You do?",
    "Really?",
    "Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.",
    "Anyway, you see if you look...",
    "There. There's my hive right there. You can see it.",
    "Yes! You know the turtle pond?",
    "I'm right off of that.",
    "Really?",
    "Why do girls put rings on their toes?",
    "I don't know. It's like putting a hat on your knee.",
    "Anyway, this has been great.",
    "Thanks for the coffee.",
    "Sorry I couldn't finish it.",
    "If I did, I'd be up for the rest of my life.",
    "Are you... Umm. Can I take a piece of this with me?",
    "Oh, thanks.",
    "All right, well, then... I guess I'll see you around, or not, or...",
    "And thank you so much again... for before.",
    "Well, not nothing, but... anyway...",
    "Oh, it was amazing.",
    "It- it was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.",
    "Huge and crazy.",
    "They talk crazy, they eat crazy giant things.",
    "They drive around real crazy.",
    "Some of them. But some of them don't.",
    "Poodle.",
    "Well...",
    "Well, I met someone.",
    "Mmm.",
    "No, no, no, not a wasp.",
    "You know, I'm not attracted to the spiders.",
    "I know to everyone else it's like the hottest thing with the eight legs and all.",
    "I can't get by that face.",
    "She's... uh... a human.",
    "Her name's Vanessa.",
    "She's so nice.",
    "And she's a florist!",
    "W-w-well, we're not dating.",
    "She saved my life.",
    "And she understands me.",
    "Eat this.",
    "They call it a crumb.",
    "And that's not even what they eat.",
    "That just falls off what they eat.",
    "Do you know what a Cinnabon is?",
    "It's bread...",
    "...and cinnamon,",
    "...and frosting.",
    "They heat it up–",
    "Really hot!",
    "Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning...",
    "I've got to start thinking bee?",
    "Well, I've got a lot of big life decisions I'm thinking about.",
    "Augh.",
    "Got everything?",
    "You go ahead. I'll catch up.",
    "Vanessa!",
    "Sorry Mom, I've got to go.",
    "Nowhere. I'm meeting a friend.",
    "Bye!",
    "So they have a huge parade of just flowers every year in Pasadena?",
    "Wow, a tournament.",
    "Do the roses actually complete in athletic events?",
    "It's exhausting.",
    "Why don't you run everywhere?",
    "Isn't that faster?",
    "Ah! Tivo.",
    "You can just freeze live TV? That's insane.",
    "We have Hivo, but it's a disease.",
    "It's a horrible, horrible disease.",
    "We really try not to sting.",
    "It's usually fatal for us.",
    "Oh yeah, very carefully.",
    "You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out.",
    "You work though it like any emotion– anger, jealousy...",
    "... lust.",
    "Yeah. Whew!",
    "What was that, a Pick and Save circular?",
    "It felt like about ten pages.",
    "Seventy-five's pretty much our limit.",
    "Oh, we have to.",
    "I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.",
    "What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?",
    "How did this get here?",
    "Cute Bee? Golden Blossom? Ray Liotta Private Select.",
    "I never heard of him.",
    "Why is this here?",
    "Why? You don't have enough food of your own?",
    "How do you even get it?",
    "I know who makes it!",
    "And it's hard to make it!",
    "There's heating and cooling, and stirring... you need a whole Krelman thing.",
    "It's our-ganic!",
    "Just... what?!",
    "Bees don't know about this.",
    "This is stealing. A lot of stealing!",
    "You've taken our homes, our schools, our hospitals.",
    "This is all we have.",
    "And it's on sale?",
    "I'm going to get to the bottom of this.",
    "I'm going to get to the bottom of all of this!",
    "You're busted, box boy!",
    "Oh, I can talk.",
    "And now you're going to start talking.",
    "Where are you getting all the sweet stuff?",
    "Who's your supplier?!",
    "You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword.",
    "Where is the honey coming from?",
    "Tell me where!",
    "Oh my. What horrible thing has happened here?",
    "Look at these faces.",
    "They never knew what hit them.",
    "And now they're on the road to nowhere.",
    "What? You're not dead?",
    "To Honey Farms.",
    "I am onto something huge here.",
    "What about you?",
    "All right.",
    "What is that?",
    "Triple blade?",
    "Moose blood guy!",
    "Hey, Blood!",
    "...and it was just an endless row of honey jars as far as the eye could see.",
    "So I'm just assuming wherever this honey truck goes, that's where they're getting it.",
    "I mean, that honey's ours!",
    "Well, we're all jammed in there.",
    "It's a close community.",
    "But what if you get in trouble?",
    "At least you're out in the world.",
    "You must meet a lot of girls.",
    "What is this place?",
    "Smoker?",
    "\"They make the honey, and we make the money\"?",
    "Oh, my!",
    "What's going on?",
    "Are you okay?",
    "How did you two get here?",
    "Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?",
    "This is your queen?",
    "That's a man in women's clothes.",
    "That's a drag-queen!",
    "What is this?",
    "Oh no. There's hundreds of them.",
    "Bee honey, our honey, is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale.",
    "This is worse than anything the bears have done to us.",
    "Do these look like rumors?",
    "Ugh.",
    "We do not.",
    "Who's side are you on?",
    "This is what I want to do for all our lives.",
    "Nobody works harder than bees.",
    "Dad, I remember you coming home some nights so overworked, you- your hands were still stirring.",
    "You couldn't stop them.",
    "What right do they have to our hard-earned honey?",
    "We're living on two cups a year.",
    "They're puttin' it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever.",
    "I'm going to sting them where it really hurts.",
    "No.",
    "No.",
    "No.",
    "There's only one place you can sting the humans.",
    "One place where it really matters.",
    "Larry, bees have never been afraid to change the world.",
    "I mean, what about Bee-Columbus? Bee-Ghandi? Be-geesus?",
    "How old are you?",
    "Thank you, Larry.",
    "You know, they have a Larry King in the human world, too.",
    "No, I mean he looks like you.",
    "And he has a show with suspenders and different colored dots behind him.",
    "Old guy glasses, and there's quotes along the bottom from the guest you're watching even though you just heard them...",
    "Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes...",
    "Very Jewish.",
    "Quiet, please.",
    "Actual work going on here.",
    "Yes it is.",
    "Oh, hello.",
    "Yeah, I remember you.",
    "Timberland, size ten and a half.",
    "Vibram sole, I believe.",
    "Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.",
    "Just one.",
    "I try not to use the competition.",
    "Ooh!",
    "So, why are you helping me, anyway?",
    "Si, Certo.",
    "Yeah, those are great... if you're three.",
    "Oh, those just get my psychotic!",
    "The bent stingers, the pointless pollination.",
    "There's nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.",
    "I guess.",
    "Am I sure?",
    "When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty.",
    "I don't know, but it's pretty big, isn't it?",
    "Hey, you think these billion dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?",
    "I don't know.",
    "I just got a chill.",
    "Ahh, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.",
    "Yes, your honor, we are ready to proceed.",
    "Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, there's no trickery here.",
    "I'm just an ordinary bee.",
    "And as a bee, honey's pretty important to me.",
    "It's important to all bees.",
    "We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our lives.",
    "Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us 'cause we're the little guys.",
    "And what I'm hoping is that after this is all over, you'll see how by taking our honey, you're not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are.",
    "So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms.",
    "Pretty big company you have there?",
    "And I see you also own Honey-Burton, and Honron!",
    "Beekeeper.",
    "I find that to be a very disturbing term, I have to say.",
    "I don't imagine you employ any bee free-ers, do you?",
    "I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.",
    "No. Because you don't free bees.",
    "You keep bees.",
    "And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey?",
    "Yeah, you mean like this?!",
    "Bears kill bees!",
    "How would you like his big hairy head crashing through your living room?",
    "Biting into your couch, spitting out your throw-pillows...rowr, rowr!",
    "Okay, that's enough. Take him away.",
    "So, Mr. Sting. Thank you for being here.",
    "Your name intrigues me, I have to say.",
    "Where have I heard it before?",
    "But you've never been a police officer of any kind, have you?",
    "No, you haven't.",
    "And so, here we have yet another example of bee culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.",
    "Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?",
    "Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.",
    "Or should I say, Mr. Gordon M. Sumner?",
    "Mr. Liotta, first may I offer my belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on E.R. in 2005.",
    "I also see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome, but with a churning inner turmoil that's always ready to blow.",
    "Not yet it isn't.",
    "But is this what it's come to for you, Mr. Liotta?",
    "Exploiting tiny helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part, and learn your lines, sir?",
    "This isn't a goodfella.",
    "This is a badfella!",
    "Well, I just think that was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.",
    "Are we doing everything right, you know, legally?",
    "Right, right.",
    "Well, here's to a great team.",
    "Hello.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So, I hear you're quite a tennis player.",
    "I'm not much for the game myself.",
    "I find the ball a little grabby.",
    "Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job.",
    "We certainly have that in common.",
    "Well, bees have 100% employment, of course.",
    "But we do jobs like taking the crud out.",
    "I’m going to go drain the ol' stinger.",
    "Huh, look at that.",
    "What's that?",
    "Mamma Mia, that's a lot of pages.",
    "Remember what Van said.",
    "Why is your life any more valuable than mine?",
    "I love the smell of flowers.",
    "Not as much.",
    "Ken, look at me!",
    "I'm wearing a chapstick hat!",
    "This is pathetic!",
    "You're bluffing.",
    "Surf's up, dude!",
    "That bowl is gnarly.",
    "I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.",
    "I couldn't overcome it.",
    "Oh, well.",
    "Oh, I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.",
    "Yeah.",
    "We're friends.",
    "Yes.",
    "What.",
    "Wait a minute this isn’t about...",
    "Hey, that’s not the kind of?",
    "Yeah, but...",
    "Yes, they are!",
    "Adam, don't!",
    "It's what he wants!",
    "Adam, stay with me.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hey, buddy.",
    "Is there much pain?",
    "It doesn't matter.",
    "The important thing is you're alive.",
    "You could have died.",
    "What was that like to sting someone?",
    "All right.",
    "Of course.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "I flew us right into this.",
    "What were we thinking?",
    "Look at us.",
    "We're just a couple of bugs in this world.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!",
    "Why?",
    "Right. Bees don't smoke.",
    "Bees don't smoke!",
    "But some bees are smoking.",
    "Adam that's it!",
    "That's our case!",
    "No, Get up, Get dressed.",
    "I've gotta go somewhere.",
    "You get back to the court and stall.",
    "Stall any way you can.",
    "Hold it, Your Honor!",
    "You want a smoking gun?",
    "Here is your smoking gun.",
    "It's a bee smoker!",
    "Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\"",
    "Is this what nature intended for us?",
    "To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps?",
    "Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!",
    "Vanessa, we won!",
    "I'm OK!",
    "Vanessa, do you know what this means?",
    "All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees.",
    "Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.",
    "All right. All right. One at a time.",
    "My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.",
    "First, we're going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.",
    "Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.",
    "We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed bad-breath stink machine.",
    "I believe we're all aware of what they do in the woods.",
    "Wait for my signal.",
    "Take him out.",
    "And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...",
    "...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.",
    "Bring it in, boys!",
    "Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.",
    "What's going on around here?",
    "Where is everybody?",
    "Are they out celebrating?",
    "At least we got our honey back.",
    "I don't understand why they're not happy.",
    "We have so much now.",
    "I thought their lives would be better!",
    "They're doing nothing.",
    "It's amazing.",
    "Honey really changes people.",
    "What did you want to show me?",
    "What happened here?",
    "Oh, no. Oh, my.",
    "They're all wilting.",
    "No.",
    "You know, I'm going to guess bees.",
    "Specifically, me.",
    "I guess I didn't think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these others things.",
    "Well, that's our whole SAT test right there.",
    "The human species?",
    "So if there's no more pollination,",
    "it could all just go south here, couldn't it?",
    "How about a suicide pact?",
    "I'll sting you, you step on me.",
    "Right, right.",
    "I had to open my mouth and talk.",
    "Vanessa?",
    "Vanessa?",
    "Why are you leaving?",
    "Where are you going?",
    "Vanessa, I just want to say I'm sorry.",
    "I never meant it to turn out like this.",
    "Tournament of Roses.",
    "Roses can't do sports.",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "Roses.",
    "Roses?",
    "Roses!",
    "Vanessa!",
    "Roses?!",
    "Roses are flowers!",
    "Flowers, bees, pollen!",
    "Maybe not.",
    "Could you ask him to slow down?",
    "OK, I made a huge mistake.",
    "This is a total disaster, and it's all my fault.",
    "I've ruined the planet. and I wanted to help you with your flower shop.",
    "Intead, I've made it worse.",
    "I thought maybe you were remodeling.",
    "Nonetheless I have another idea, and it's greater than all my previous great ideas combined.",
    "All right, here’s what I’m thinking.",
    "They have the roses, the roses have the pollen.",
    "I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.",
    "All we got do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.",
    "Park.",
    "Flowers.",
    "Across the nation!",
    "Alright Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.",
    "They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.",
    "Security will be tight.",
    "Then once we're inside, we just pick the right float.",
    "Yeah!",
    "...yes, I think",
    "I’ve got it.",
    "Sorry I'm late Where should I sit?",
    "I believe I'm the pea.",
    "Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.",
    "You do that!",
    "This whole parade is a fiasco!",
    "Let's see what this baby will do.",
    "Then all we do is blend in with traffic...",
    "...without arousing suspicion.",
    "And once we’re at the airport there's no stopping us.",
    "That's part of me.",
    "Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.",
    "Can you believe how lucky we are?",
    "We have just enough pollen to do the job!",
    "I think this is going to work, Vanessa!",
    "I've got to get up there and talk to these guys.",
    "Hey, can I get some help with this Sky Mall magazine?",
    "I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.",
    "Excuse me, Captain, I'm in a real situation here.",
    "No, no! Don't freak out!",
    "There's a chance my entire species...",
    "Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!",
    "Oh, Barry.",
    "Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain speaking.",
    "Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?",
    "And please hurry!",
    "I tried to talk to them, but then there was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.",
    "Now one's bald, one's in a boat, and they're both unconscious!",
    "No!",
    "No one's flying the plane!",
    "As a matter of fact, there is.",
    "Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.",
    "It's got giant wings, huge engines.",
    "Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?",
    "How hard could it be?",
    "Hey, hold on a second.",
    "Haven't we heard this a million times?",
    "\"The surface area of the wings and body mass doesn't make sense.\"",
    "Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you.",
    "Because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.",
    "But let me tell you something about a small job.",
    "If you do it really well, it makes a big difference.",
    "More than we realized.",
    "To us, to everyone.",
    "That's why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best working together.",
    "That's the bee way!",
    "We're not made of Jell-O.",
    "We get behind a fellow.",
    "Black and yellow!",
    "Left, right, down, hover.",
    "Forget hover.",
    "Wait a minute, I think we were on autopilot that whole time.",
    "And now we're not!",
    "Our only chance is if I do what I would do, and you copy me with the wings of the plane!",
    "I'm not yelling!",
    "We happen to be in a lot of trouble here.",
    "It's not a tone.",
    "I'm panicking!",
    "Vanessa, pull yourself together.",
    "Listen to me! You have got to snap out of it!",
    "You snap out of it.",
    "You snap out of it!",
    "You snap out of it!",
    "You snap out of it!",
    "Why? Come on, it's my turn.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Hello?",
    "The Pollen Jocks!",
    "Black and yellow.",
    "No, nothing.",
    "It's all cloudy.",
    "Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.",
    "I don't know. But it's strong, and it's pulling me.",
    "Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.",
    "Bring the nose of the plane down.",
    "Vanessa, aim for the flower.",
    "Cut the engines.",
    "We're going in on bee power.",
    "Ready, boys?",
    "Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.",
    "Land on that flower!",
    "Ready, boys? Full reverse!",
    "Not that flower! The other flower!",
    "That flower.",
    "That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.",
    "I mean the giant black and yellow flower pulsating made of millions of bees!",
    "Pull forward. Nose down. Bring your tail up.",
    "Rotate around it.",
    "This is the only way I know how to fly.",
    "Get your nose in there.",
    "Don't be afraid of it. Smell it.",
    "Full reverse!",
    "Easy just drop it.",
    "Be a part of it.",
    "Aim for the center!",
    "Now drop it in!",
    "Drop it in, woman!",
    "Yes. No high-five!",
    "What giant flower? Where?",
    "Of course I saw the flower!",
    "That was genius man! Genius!",
    "But we're not done yet.",
    "Listen, everyone!",
    "This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.",
    "That means this is our last chance.",
    "We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this.",
    "If we're going to survive as a species, this is our moment!",
    "So, what do you all say?",
    "Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?",
    "Then everyone, follow me! Except Keychain.",
    "I'm a Pollen Jock!",
    "And it's a perfect fit.",
    "All I got to do are the sleeves.",
    "Oh, yeah.",
    "Uh huh. Uh huh.",
    "I had no idea.",
    "Would you excuse me?",
    "My mosquito associate here will be able to help you.",
    "No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.",
    "All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.",
    "Beautiful day to fly.",
    "Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.",
    "Woah-ho-ho!",
    "Me?",
    "Gee!",
    "I'm lovin' the views.",
    "Or not to be.",
    "What, you mean like pollination?",
    "I just want to be sure!",
    "Can't I wait and see?",
    "Alright, hold it, hold it, hold it.",
    "Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?",
    "I'm not making a major life decision in the middle of a huge musical production number!",
    "I had virtually no rehearsal for that."
